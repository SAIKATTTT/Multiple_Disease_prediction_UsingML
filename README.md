# Multiple Disease Prediction

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting multiple diseases based on symptoms and health indicators. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in a CSV file named `MultipleDiseasePrediction.csv`, containing patient health records with various symptoms and diagnosed diseases.

# Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Exploration**: Inspect the first and last few rows, check for missing values, and understand the data structure.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the distribution of diseases and feature correlations.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize features.
5. **Feature and Target Definition**: Separate the dataset into feature variables (X) and target variable (y).
6. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
7. **Model Training**: Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training set.
8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
9. **Prediction**: Use the model to make predictions on new data.
